## what is this?
This is a random package again from me which you can use to get the tags which
can be accomodated in the given parent width. Rest of the element count will be shown as  `+ count`

## Why is this useful ?
Well, what if you want to show only those tags which can fit in given width ? thats where this comes handly. For now this is just a html code, so no big expectations. 

## Current status
Currently, this is not a package, but go through the sinple vanila.js code and you can get the logic.
And use the logic on different frontend frameworks as you like
